<p>
    TrackMage uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.
    In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that resulted from
    the provided information (e.g. a required parameter was missing, an endpoint is not found, etc.),
    and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with TrackMage server.
</p>
<p>
    In the event of a client or server error, the response will contain the standard 4xx or 5xx respectively,
    accompanied by a description of the error in the <a target="_blank"
        href="https://www.hydra-cg.com/spec/latest/core/#description-of-http-status-codes-and-errors"
        title="Hydra error format">Hydra error format</a> or in the format described in
    the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807" title="RFC 7807">RFC 7807</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Each client library will encapsulate these errors and raise an exception, in addition to other exceptional cases,
    such as network failures. It is recommended to handle exceptions gracefully.
