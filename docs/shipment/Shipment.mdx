All Shipment objects are associated with a specific [Workspace](./Workspace.mdx), that is why workspace is present in all shipments,
and it is required during creation.

The trackingNumber is required for the tracking.

A Shipment created with a valid **trackingNumber** will automatically populate its tracking information.

Tracking information (origin carrier, destination carrier, tracking status, etc.) is generated by TrackMage and
cannot be modified by the user.

**Address** and **shipmentStatus** contained within a Shipment may be created at the same time.

## What you can do with Shipment

<ResourceMethods resourceName="Shipment" toc={true}/>

## ShipmentItem Properties

<ResourceFields schemaName="Shipment-Get" />

## Endpoints

<ResourceMethods resourceName="Shipment" />
