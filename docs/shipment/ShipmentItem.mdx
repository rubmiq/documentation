Each Shipment Item contains information about the shipped [OrderItem](../order/OrderItem.mdx) in the [Shipment](./Shipment.mdx).

When you create or update a ShipmentItem our system validates the Quantity can be fulfilled.
Available quantity is calculated depending on `orderItem.qty - orderItem.fulfilledQty`.

ShipmentItems will be deleted automatically on delete parent [Shipment](./Shipment.mdx) object or related [OrderItem](../order/OrderItem.mdx) object.

:::note
Once a ShipmentItem is created you cannot change the shipment, but you can change OrderItem and Quantity.
